The Bilingual (Blocked) Stroop - comparing Stroop interference effects across languages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment: 
    
    Reading words in your native language is a very overlearned task, which is 
    difficult to suppress. Hence, when asked to report the color of a word in the 
    classic Stroop task,the semantic context of the text can interfere with what 
    should be a simple color judgement - i.e., the Stroop effect. The Stroop effect 
    should be larger in the language in which one is most fluent, rather than a 
    language in which one is familiar. This Bilingual (Blocked) Stroop can demonstrate 
    this, running the classic Stroop task in the English and Maori language. In this 
    task subjects must report the colour of the letters spelling each word, but 
    letters themselves also spell a colour name and this may be the same or different 
    to the colour of the letters. Words will be English or Maori, depending on 
    the condition.

Analysing your data:

    After you run the study, look in the data/ folder next to where the 
    experiment was saved. There will be an xlsx file there that can be opened
    with Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet package. Each row represents
    one condition (trial type) and each column is one variable of your experiment
    or type of data collected. 
    Take the average of the resp.mean_rt column for the 3 congruent conditions 
    and compare them with the 3 incongruent conditions and compare this Stroop effect 
    across languages. In most cases the incongruent conditions will have larger 
    reactions times, and this effect will be larger for the fluent or native language
    compared with the familiar, non-native language.
